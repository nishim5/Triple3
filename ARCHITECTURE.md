A network flow diagram is a visual representation that indicates the routes over which data travels, the internal and external nodes on which it is stored or processed, and the purpose of those nodes. 

In this case, the flow starts off from a user story of a college graduate to creating options for the user to choose in terms of a recipe to their liking. 

Given the options, they have choices of a bunch of variables like gluten-free, vegan, add-ons, alternatives, and a lot more.
