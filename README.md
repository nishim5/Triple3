Our team has a working idea of building a cooking bot that will store some recipies and interact with the user.



# Cooking Bot Version 1.0

1. When the user requests a recipe on discord using the command /recipe, our cooking bot will display a list of 5 recipes.
2. The user can pick the recipe of their choice by using the /pick command and enter the number associated with the recipe.
3. The cooking bot will display the ingrediants, the instructions, as well as a list of potential allengens.
4. The user has the option to request an alternative recipe using the /allergen command and entering their allergen.
5. The cooking bot will then display the alternative recipe.
